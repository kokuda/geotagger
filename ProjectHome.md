Geotagging is a method of adding GPS data to the EXIF header of photographs (found in JPEG and other file formats).

Geotagger is a tool to help geotag photos.  This can be done manually by locating a spot on a map or automatically by correlating with data from a GPS.

Geotagger is written in C# and uses Google Maps in an embedded web browser for visualizing the GPS data and photo locations.

This tool is meant to do only one thing - Geotag photos.  It will not create KML files, it will not create GPX files, it will not resize photos, it will not post photos to web sites.  It will just write GPS data into EXIF headers of photographs.
